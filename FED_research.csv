The New York Fed DSGE Model Forecast—March 2022, The authors present an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model.

Global Supply Chain Pressure Index: March 2022 Update," Supply chain disruptions continue to be a major challenge. In January, the authors presented the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) as a parsimonious global measure that encompasses several indicators used to capture supply chain disruptions. This post shows that the GSCPI, from November to February, points to an easing in global supply chain pressures even though they remain at very high levels historically. These data are used to create country-specific supply chain pressure indices.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/03/global-supply-chain-pressure-index-march-2022-update/
Disinflation Policies with a Flat Phillips Curve, The authors use the New York Fed DSGE model to study how alternative monetary policy strategies might contribute to bringing inflation back down to 2 percent. Their main finding is that there is no monetary silver bullet. Due to a flat Phillips curve—a well-documented feature of the economic environment of the last three decades—monetary policy can only achieve faster disinflation at a considerable cost in terms of forgone economic activity. This is true regardless of the systematic approach followed by the central bank in the model to pursue its objective.,https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/03/disinflation-policies-with-a-flat-phillips-curve/
Drivers of Inflation: The New York Fed DSGE Model’s Perspective," After a sharp decline in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rebounded in the second half of 2020 and surged throughout 2021. This post analyzes the drivers of these developments through the lens of the New York Fed DSGE model. Its main finding is that the recent rise in inflation is mostly accounted for by a large cost-push shock that occurred in the second quarter of 2021 and whose inflationary effects persist today.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/03/drivers-of-inflation-the-new-york-fed-dsge-models-perspective/
Car Prices Drive Up Borrowing," Total household debt increased by $1.02 trillion in 2021, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data. Outstanding auto loan balances grew by $85 billion last year, with $734 billion in newly opened loans through the year—the largest volume the authors have seen in the Quarterly Report data. In this post, the authors take a closer look at newly opened auto loans, and how the price increases in auto loans have been borne by different groups.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/02/car-prices-drive-up-borrowing/

The Global Dash for Cash: Why Sovereign Bond Market Functioning Varied across Jurisdictions in March 2020," As the economic disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic increased in March 2020, there was a global dash-for-cash by investors. This selling pressure occurred across advanced sovereign bond markets and caused a deterioration in market functioning, leading to central bank interventions. The authors show that these market disruptions occurred disproportionately in the U.S. Treasury market and were due to investors’ selling pressures being far more pronounced and broad-based.",/research/staff_reports/sr1010
"Money Market Fund Vulnerabilities: A Global Perspective
"," Money market funds (MMFs) operate in a niche between the capital markets and the banking system, as investment funds that offer private money-like assets with features similar to those of bank deposits. Hence, they are vulnerable to runs that arise from liquidity transformation and from sudden changes in investor perceptions of the funds’ ability to serve as money-like assets. Since 2000, MMF runs have occurred in many countries and under many regulatory regimes. The global pattern of runs and crises shows that MMF vulnerabilities are not unique to a particular set of governing arrangements, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities requires fundamental reforms that either place MMFs more clearly within the investment-fund sector or establish protections for MMFs similar to those for deposits.",/research/staff_reports/sr1009
Monetary Policy and the Run Risk of Loan Funds," Open-end mutual funds have become increasingly important financial intermediaries, and the volatility of their investors' flows can have major repercussions for financial stability. The authors find empirical evidence suggesting that loan funds, which are key credit providers in the leveraged lending market, are much more vulnerable to run risk than any other category of debt mutual funds. Building on the institutional features of the asset holdings of loan funds, the authors further document the role of monetary policy as a coordinating factor driving loan funds' investor flows and their volatility, suggesting a novel channel of monetary policy transmission. ",/research/staff_reports/sr1008
A New Approach to Assess Inflation Expectations Anchoring Using Strategic Surveys," Long-run inflation expectations that are consistent with an (implicit or explicit) central bank’s inflation objective are viewed as one measure of successful monetary policy. The authors propose a new approach for assessing the anchoring of inflation expectations using “strategic surveys.” Namely, they measure households’ revisions in long-run inflation expectations after they are presented with different economic scenarios. A key advantage of this approach is that it provides a causal interpretation in terms of how inflation events affect long-run inflation expectations.",/research/staff_reports/sr1007
Government Procurement and Access to Credit: Firm Dynamics and Aggregate Implications," A government’s purchase of goods and services is done by awarding public procurement contracts to private firms. The authors employ a newly created panel data set of administrative data that merges Spanish credit register loan data, quasi-census ﬁrm-level data, and public procurement projects to study ﬁrm selection into procurement and the eﬀects of procurement on credit growth and ﬁrm growth.",/research/staff_reports/sr1006
Who Can Tell Which Banks Will Fail?," Understanding depositor behavior in banking crises is key to evaluating the policy measures to prevent them. In this paper, the authors ask—in the absence of deposit insurance—how do depositors behave in a bank run? They study a key event of the Great Depression, the 1931 run on the German banking system, to establish which types of depositors are able to discriminate between failing and surviving banks in a bank run.",/research/staff_reports/sr1005
Exorbitant Privilege? Quantitative Easing and the Bond Market Subsidy of Prospective Fallen Angels," Prospective fallen angels—risky firms just above the investment-grade (IG) rating cutoff—have enjoyed subsidized bond financing since 2009, especially when the scale of quantitative easing (QE) purchases peaked and from IG-focused investors that held more securities purchased in QE programs. The benefiting firms used this privilege to fund risky acquisitions and increase market share, exploiting the sluggish adjustment of credit ratings in downgrading after M&A and adversely affecting competitors' employment and investment. Eventually, these firms suffered more severe downgrades at the onset of the pandemic. ",/research/staff_reports/sr1004
Financial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy: Empirical Evidence and Challenges," The authors review literature on the empirical relationship between vulnerabilities in the financial system and the macroeconomy, and how monetary policy affects that connection.
